# Current Session Status - January 2025

## Latest Session Progress (January 12, 2025)

### Phase 1: COMPLETED ✅
- **Created** `/supabase/functions/option-expirations/index.ts` edge function
- **Updated** `PolygonTester.tsx` to use the edge function with proper auth headers
- **Deployed** the edge function successfully
- **Fixed** API key issue - replaced invalid key with working key
- **Added** POLYGON_API_KEY to Supabase secrets
- **Tested** successfully - option expirations are loading!

### Phase 2: COMPLETED ✅
- **Tested** $61 strike with Sep 19, 2025 expiration
- **Verified** all fields in the response including Greeks
- **Documented** API response format in PolygonTester
- **Note**: Bid/ask are null as expected (will fix in Phase 3)

### What We Accomplished Today
1. ✅ Deployed option-expirations edge function
2. ✅ Fixed authentication with Authorization header
3. ✅ Updated Polygon API key to valid one
4. ✅ Successfully fetched real option expiration dates
5. ✅ Successfully fetched option data with Greeks
6. ✅ Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub

### Current State of Application
- PolygonTester is fully functional at `http://localhost:5173?test=polygon`
- Successfully fetching real option expiration dates from Polygon
- Option data includes all Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega, IV)
- Bid/ask are null (expected - needs Phase 3 implementation)

### Next Steps - Phase 3.1: CRITICAL BUG FIX ⚡
1. **Portfolio Vision Parsing Failure** (IMMEDIATE):
   - AI response JSON parsing is failing in portfolio-vision edge function
   - Zero positions being extracted from portfolio uploads
   - Post-processing code crashes when parsing option expiry dates
   - Created test script confirms "Failed to parse AI response as valid JSON"
   
2. **Fix Strategy**:
   - Add defensive error handling around date parsing in post-processing
   - Ensure raw AI response is preserved even if post-processing fails
   - Test with actual portfolio image using test-portfolio-vision.cjs
   - Deploy fix and verify main application works

### Completed - Phase 3
1. ✅ **Fixed bid/ask null issue**: Documented as Polygon plan limitation
2. ✅ **Fixed option-chain API**: Authentication headers added  
3. ✅ **Tested with real data**: All endpoints working correctly

### Key Files Modified
1. `/supabase/functions/option-expirations/index.ts` - NEW edge function
2. `/src/components/PolygonTester.tsx` - Updated to use edge function

### Todo Status
- ✅ Phase 1.1: Create /option-expirations edge function
- ✅ Phase 1.2: Update PolygonTester to use edge function
- ⏳ Phase 2.1: Test $61 strike for each expiration (waiting for deployment)
- ⏳ Phase 2.2: Document API response format

### Important Context
- Working on fixing Polygon CORS issue by using edge functions
- Goal: Display real option expiration dates from Polygon
- Currently filtering for specific months: Jan 2026, Dec 2025, Nov 2025, Sep 2025
- Using $61 strike as initial test case

## Latest Session Progress (July 13, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 3.8: Wheel P&L Patch Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- **Problem**: P&L only showed mark-to-market losses, not wheel strategy profits
- **Solution**: Implemented dual P&L metrics:
  - `optionMTM`: Traditional mark-to-market P&L (paper gains/losses)
  - `wheelNet`: Wheel strategy net profit (real profit if assigned)
- **Backend Changes**:
  - Updated `calcOptionMetrics` function in integrated-analysis
  - Extract cost basis from portfolio positions ($59.09 for IBIT)
  - Added proper TypeScript types and cleaned up code
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Display wheelNet as large bold Strategy P&L (green/red)
  - Show optionMTM as small gray MTM text
  - Maintained existing card layout
- **Results**: $63 CALL example shows optionMTM: -$1,172 vs wheelNet: +$2,796
- **Testing**: End-to-end verified with real portfolio data
- **Status**: Code reviewed, deployed, and documented

### Previous Fixes Completed ✅
- **Premium Calculation**: Fixed frontend multiplying by 100 unnecessarily
- **AI Response Truncation**: Fixed with increased tokens and JSON mode  
- **Portfolio Vision**: All 6 IBIT positions (14 contracts) extracted correctly
- **Number Formatting**: All displays show whole numbers (no decimals)
- **Total Premium**: Shows $16,219 dynamically from uploaded positions

### Session Summary
- ✅ All critical P&L calculation bugs resolved
- ✅ Wheel strategy metrics working correctly
- ✅ Backend and frontend integration complete
- ✅ Code review standards met
- ✅ Documentation updated and comprehensive
- ✅ Ready for Phase 3.9

## Latest Session Progress (July 14, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 3.9: Option Greeks Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- **Implementation**: Created comprehensive Greeks fetching system
- **Components Created**:
  - `greeksFetcher.ts`: Service with rate limiting (5/min) and caching (1hr)
  - Integrated Greeks fetching after portfolio upload
  - Updated integrated-analysis to use real Greeks
  - Enhanced UI to display Greeks and assignment probability
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic Greeks fetching for all option positions
  - Smart caching with localStorage persistence
  - Rate limiting to respect Polygon API limits
  - Assignment probability based on real delta values
  - Stale data indicators (>30 minutes)
- **Testing**: Created unit tests and end-to-end test
- **Status**: Fully implemented and ready for deployment

### Greeks Display in UI
- Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, IV shown for each position
- Assignment probability color-coded (red >70%, yellow 30-70%, green <30%)
- Theta shown as $/day for easy understanding
- "N/A" displayed when Greeks unavailable

## Next Session Instructions
1. **Start Phase 4**: Fix Wheel Strategy Metrics
   - Implement all wheel strategy formulas
   - Connect real Polygon data to calculations
   - Test with real positions
2. **Continue to Phase 5**: Number Formatting
   - Create formatting utilities
   - Apply to all financial displays
3. **Goal**: Complete wheel strategy metrics with professional formatting
