# Current Session Status - January 2025

## Latest Session Progress (January 12, 2025)

### Phase 1: COMPLETED ✅
- **Created** `/supabase/functions/option-expirations/index.ts` edge function
- **Updated** `PolygonTester.tsx` to use the edge function with proper auth headers
- **Deployed** the edge function successfully
- **Fixed** API key issue - replaced invalid key with working key
- **Added** POLYGON_API_KEY to Supabase secrets
- **Tested** successfully - option expirations are loading!

### Phase 2: COMPLETED ✅
- **Tested** $61 strike with Sep 19, 2025 expiration
- **Verified** all fields in the response including Greeks
- **Documented** API response format in PolygonTester
- **Note**: Bid/ask are null as expected (will fix in Phase 3)

### What We Accomplished Today
1. ✅ Deployed option-expirations edge function
2. ✅ Fixed authentication with Authorization header
3. ✅ Updated Polygon API key to valid one
4. ✅ Successfully fetched real option expiration dates
5. ✅ Successfully fetched option data with Greeks
6. ✅ Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub

### Current State of Application
- PolygonTester is fully functional at `http://localhost:5173?test=polygon`
- Successfully fetching real option expiration dates from Polygon
- Option data includes all Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega, IV)
- Bid/ask are null (expected - needs Phase 3 implementation)

### Next Steps - Phase 3.1: CRITICAL BUG FIX ⚡
1. **Portfolio Vision Parsing Failure** (IMMEDIATE):
   - AI response JSON parsing is failing in portfolio-vision edge function
   - Zero positions being extracted from portfolio uploads
   - Post-processing code crashes when parsing option expiry dates
   - Created test script confirms "Failed to parse AI response as valid JSON"
   
2. **Fix Strategy**:
   - Add defensive error handling around date parsing in post-processing
   - Ensure raw AI response is preserved even if post-processing fails
   - Test with actual portfolio image using test-portfolio-vision.cjs
   - Deploy fix and verify main application works

### Completed - Phase 3
1. ✅ **Fixed bid/ask null issue**: Documented as Polygon plan limitation
2. ✅ **Fixed option-chain API**: Authentication headers added  
3. ✅ **Tested with real data**: All endpoints working correctly

### Key Files Modified
1. `/supabase/functions/option-expirations/index.ts` - NEW edge function
2. `/src/components/PolygonTester.tsx` - Updated to use edge function

### Todo Status
- ✅ Phase 1.1: Create /option-expirations edge function
- ✅ Phase 1.2: Update PolygonTester to use edge function
- ⏳ Phase 2.1: Test $61 strike for each expiration (waiting for deployment)
- ⏳ Phase 2.2: Document API response format

### Important Context
- Working on fixing Polygon CORS issue by using edge functions
- Goal: Display real option expiration dates from Polygon
- Currently filtering for specific months: Jan 2026, Dec 2025, Nov 2025, Sep 2025
- Using $61 strike as initial test case

## Latest Session Progress (July 13, 2025)

### Premium Calculation Fix ✅
- **Issue**: User reported 14 covered call contracts but only seeing partial data
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Confusion between POSITIONS (6) vs CONTRACTS (14)
  - Frontend multiplying premium by 100 unnecessarily
  - AI response truncating to only 3 positions
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Pre-computed P&L metrics on backend
  - Fixed frontend premium calculation
  - Added total tracking for all positions
- **Result**: Correctly shows $16,219.27 total premium (matches user expectation)

### Current Status
- Portfolio-vision correctly extracts all 6 IBIT positions (14 contracts)
- Integrated-analysis receives all data correctly
- Frontend calculation fixed to show correct premium totals
- Premium calculation is DYNAMIC from uploaded positions (NOT hardcoded)
- Total premium shows $16,219 (matches user expectation)
- All dollar amounts now display as whole numbers (no decimals)
- Documentation created in `/docs/OPTION_PREMIUM_FIX.md`

### Current Work - Phase 3.8: Wheel P&L Patch
- Implementing two P&L metrics: optionMTM (mark-to-market) and wheelNet (strategy profit)
- Using real cost basis from portfolio positions ($59 for IBIT)
- Frontend will display wheelNet prominently, optionMTM as gray text
- Testing with end-to-end flow using real portfolio image

## Next Session Instructions
1. Complete Phase 3.8 wheel P&L implementation
2. Test end-to-end flow with real data
3. Verify UI displays correct metrics
4. Run code review hook after completion
