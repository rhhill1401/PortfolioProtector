# Current Session Status - January 2025

## Latest Session Progress (January 12, 2025)

### Phase 1: COMPLETED ✅
- **Created** `/supabase/functions/option-expirations/index.ts` edge function
- **Updated** `PolygonTester.tsx` to use the edge function with proper auth headers
- **Deployed** the edge function successfully
- **Fixed** API key issue - replaced invalid key with working key
- **Added** POLYGON_API_KEY to Supabase secrets
- **Tested** successfully - option expirations are loading!

### Phase 2: COMPLETED ✅
- **Tested** $61 strike with Sep 19, 2025 expiration
- **Verified** all fields in the response including Greeks
- **Documented** API response format in PolygonTester
- **Note**: Bid/ask are null as expected (will fix in Phase 3)

### What We Accomplished Today
1. ✅ Deployed option-expirations edge function
2. ✅ Fixed authentication with Authorization header
3. ✅ Updated Polygon API key to valid one
4. ✅ Successfully fetched real option expiration dates
5. ✅ Successfully fetched option data with Greeks
6. ✅ Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub

### Current State of Application
- PolygonTester is fully functional at `http://localhost:5173?test=polygon`
- Successfully fetching real option expiration dates from Polygon
- Option data includes all Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega, IV)
- Bid/ask are null (expected - needs Phase 3 implementation)

### Next Steps - Phase 3.1: CRITICAL BUG FIX ⚡
1. **Portfolio Vision Parsing Failure** (IMMEDIATE):
   - AI response JSON parsing is failing in portfolio-vision edge function
   - Zero positions being extracted from portfolio uploads
   - Post-processing code crashes when parsing option expiry dates
   - Created test script confirms "Failed to parse AI response as valid JSON"
   
2. **Fix Strategy**:
   - Add defensive error handling around date parsing in post-processing
   - Ensure raw AI response is preserved even if post-processing fails
   - Test with actual portfolio image using test-portfolio-vision.cjs
   - Deploy fix and verify main application works

### Completed - Phase 3
1. ✅ **Fixed bid/ask null issue**: Documented as Polygon plan limitation
2. ✅ **Fixed option-chain API**: Authentication headers added  
3. ✅ **Tested with real data**: All endpoints working correctly

### Key Files Modified
1. `/supabase/functions/option-expirations/index.ts` - NEW edge function
2. `/src/components/PolygonTester.tsx` - Updated to use edge function

### Todo Status
- ✅ Phase 1.1: Create /option-expirations edge function
- ✅ Phase 1.2: Update PolygonTester to use edge function
- ⏳ Phase 2.1: Test $61 strike for each expiration (waiting for deployment)
- ⏳ Phase 2.2: Document API response format

### Important Context
- Working on fixing Polygon CORS issue by using edge functions
- Goal: Display real option expiration dates from Polygon
- Currently filtering for specific months: Jan 2026, Dec 2025, Nov 2025, Sep 2025
- Using $61 strike as initial test case

## Latest Session Progress (July 13, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 3.8: Wheel P&L Patch Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- **Problem**: P&L only showed mark-to-market losses, not wheel strategy profits
- **Solution**: Implemented dual P&L metrics:
  - `optionMTM`: Traditional mark-to-market P&L (paper gains/losses)
  - `wheelNet`: Wheel strategy net profit (real profit if assigned)
- **Backend Changes**:
  - Updated `calcOptionMetrics` function in integrated-analysis
  - Extract cost basis from portfolio positions ($59.09 for IBIT)
  - Added proper TypeScript types and cleaned up code
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Display wheelNet as large bold Strategy P&L (green/red)
  - Show optionMTM as small gray MTM text
  - Maintained existing card layout
- **Results**: $63 CALL example shows optionMTM: -$1,172 vs wheelNet: +$2,796
- **Testing**: End-to-end verified with real portfolio data
- **Status**: Code reviewed, deployed, and documented

### Previous Fixes Completed ✅
- **Premium Calculation**: Fixed frontend multiplying by 100 unnecessarily
- **AI Response Truncation**: Fixed with increased tokens and JSON mode  
- **Portfolio Vision**: All 6 IBIT positions (14 contracts) extracted correctly
- **Number Formatting**: All displays show whole numbers (no decimals)
- **Total Premium**: Shows $16,219 dynamically from uploaded positions

### Session Summary
- ✅ All critical P&L calculation bugs resolved
- ✅ Wheel strategy metrics working correctly
- ✅ Backend and frontend integration complete
- ✅ Code review standards met
- ✅ Documentation updated and comprehensive
- ✅ Ready for Phase 3.9

## Latest Session Progress (July 14, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 3.9: Option Greeks Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- **Implementation**: Created comprehensive Greeks fetching system
- **Components Created**:
  - `greeksFetcher.ts`: Service with rate limiting (5/min) and caching (1hr)
  - Integrated Greeks fetching after portfolio upload
  - Updated integrated-analysis to use real Greeks
  - Enhanced UI to display Greeks and assignment probability
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic Greeks fetching for all option positions
  - Smart caching with localStorage persistence
  - Rate limiting to respect Polygon API limits
  - Assignment probability based on real delta values
  - Stale data indicators (>30 minutes)
- **Testing**: Created unit tests and end-to-end test
- **Status**: Fully implemented, tested, and committed to GitHub

### Critical Bug Fixed
- **Issue**: Greeks API returning 400 errors due to date format mismatch
- **Root Cause**: Portfolio-vision returning "Jul-18-2025" format, Polygon expects "2025-07-18"
- **Fix**: Added date conversion in TickerPriceSearch.tsx
- **Lesson**: End-to-end tests must use actual API responses, not mock data
- **Documentation**: Created `/docs/bugs-and-fixes/001-greeks-date-format-bug.md`

### Greeks Display in UI
- Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, IV shown for each position
- Assignment probability color-coded (red >70%, yellow 30-70%, green <30%)
- Theta shown as $/day for easy understanding (fixed 100x multiplier bug)
- "N/A" displayed when Greeks unavailable

### Code Review Improvements Applied
- Fixed sliding window rate limiting bug
- Added proper TypeScript types for optionGreeks
- Fixed theta display calculation
- Added token limit protection (15 positions max)
- Improved test coverage with real data

## Next Session Instructions (Phase 4: Fix Wheel Strategy Metrics)

### Current Issues to Fix
1. **Total Premium Collected**: Shows $0 instead of actual $16,219
2. **Unrealized P&L**: Shows "Loading..." indefinitely
3. **Cost to Close**: Shows "Loading..." indefinitely
4. **Max Profit Potential**: Shows $0.00
5. **Next 30-45% Wheel Opportunity**: Shows hardcoded IBIT $72 CALL
6. **Assignment Probability**: Shows static 8% instead of dynamic calculation

### Implementation Tasks
1. **Debug why metrics don't display**
   - Check data flow from analysis to wheel metrics component
   - Verify calculations are receiving correct data
   
2. **Connect real data to calculations**
   - Total premium from all positions
   - Current market values for P&L
   - Live quotes for cost to close
   
3. **Implement formulas**:
   - Annualized Return = (credit/capital) × (365/DTE) × 100
   - Assignment Probability from actual Greeks (delta-based)
   - Compounded 12-month returns
   - Max profit potential calculations
   
4. **Fix "Next Wheel Opportunity"**
   - Calculate optimal next strike based on current price
   - Use real market data and Greeks
   - Show actual optimal contract, not hardcoded

### Key Files to Review
- `/src/components/StockAnalysis.tsx` - Wheel metrics display
- `/src/services/wheelMath.ts` - Calculation functions
- `/src/hooks/useWheelQuotes.ts` - Live quote fetching
- Analysis data structure for available fields
