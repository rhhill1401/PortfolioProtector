  - [x] Integrated analysis test script (test-integrated-analysis.cjs)
  - [x] Real data test script (test-integrated-analysis-real-data.cjs)
- [x] Use actual portfolio image for testing
  - [x] /Users/Killmunger/Documents/examples-portfolio/curreentportfolio.png
  - [x] Extracts 6 IBIT + 2 NVDA positions correctly
- [x] Save test responses for debugging
  - [x] Portfolio vision responses saved to JSON
  - [x] Integrated analysis responses saved with timestamps
- [x] Created test infrastructure that helped fix:
  - [x] JSON parsing issues
  - [x] Premium calculation bugs
  - [x] Position extraction verification

### üö® CRITICAL BUG FIXES

#### Phase 3.6: Fix Premium Calculation & Display ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Fix frontend multiplying premium by 100 unnecessarily

- [x] Document fix in OPTION_PREMIUM_FIX.md

#### Phase 3.7: Fix P&L Calculation Bug ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Identified issue: Need two P&L metrics (optionMTM vs wheelNet)
- [x] Implemented backend wheel analytics (intrinsic/extrinsic values)
- [x] Enhanced AI prompt with assignment probability analysis
- [x] Added wheel strategy recommendations (HOLD/ROLL/LET_ASSIGN)
- [x] Fixed decimal display to show whole numbers only

#### Phase 3.8: Implement Wheel P&L Patch üéØ CURRENT
- [ ] Add optionMTM calculation: (premiumCollected - currentValue) √ó |contracts|
