# Session Handoff - July 13, 2025

## Session Summary: Phase 3.8 Wheel P&L Patch ✅ COMPLETED

### 🎯 Major Achievement
Successfully implemented dual P&L metrics for wheel strategy traders:
- **optionMTM**: Mark-to-market P&L (traditional view)
- **wheelNet**: Wheel strategy profit (what traders actually care about)

### 📊 Key Result
$63 CALL example (4 contracts):
- Shows optionMTM: -$1,172 (paper loss) 
- Shows wheelNet: +$2,796 (strategy profit)
- **Impact**: Traders can now see their strategy is profitable despite paper losses!

### ✅ All Critical Bugs Resolved
- [x] P&L Calculation - Fixed with dual metrics
- [x] AI Response Truncation - Fixed with increased tokens
- [x] Premium Calculation - Fixed unnecessary multiplication
- [x] Number Formatting - Whole numbers only
- [x] Portfolio Vision - All 6 positions extracted correctly

## 🚀 Tomorrow's Plan: Phase 3.9 - Option Greeks Integration

### Primary Goal
Fetch real-time option Greeks from Polygon API after portfolio upload

### Implementation Steps
1. **Extract option positions** from uploaded portfolio
2. **Call Polygon API** to fetch Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega, IV)
3. **Store Greeks data** for enhanced wheel strategy recommendations
4. **Integrate with existing** wheel analysis

### Files to Focus On
- `src/hooks/useOptionChain.ts` - Already has Polygon integration
- `supabase/functions/integrated-analysis/index.ts` - Add Greeks data
- Portfolio upload flow - Trigger Greeks fetch after vision processing

### Success Criteria
- Real-time Greeks displayed in Performance tab
- Enhanced assignment probability calculations
- More accurate wheel strategy recommendations

## 📁 Current State
- **Backend**: All functions deployed and working (integrated-analysis v37)
- **Frontend**: Wheel P&L display implemented correctly
- **Testing**: End-to-end flow verified with real data
- **Documentation**: Complete and up-to-date

## 🔄 Next Session Startup
1. Review Phase 3.9 requirements in IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
2. Check existing Polygon integration in useOptionChain.ts
3. Start with extracting option positions after portfolio upload
4. Test Greeks API calls with real IBIT data

**Ready to pick up with Phase 3.9 Option Greeks integration!** 🚀
