# User Stories for Phases 1-3

## Phase 1: Fix Polygon Option Discovery

### User Story 1.1: Create Option Expirations Edge Function
**As a** developer  
**I want** a Supabase edge function that fetches available option expiration dates  
**So that** the frontend can display real option dates without CORS errors

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Edge function endpoint `/option-expirations` is created and deployed
- [x] Function accepts `ticker` parameter (e.g., "IBIT")
- [x] Function returns JSON array of expiration dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
- [x] Function filters results for months: Jan 2026, Dec 2025, Nov 2025, Sep 2025
- [x] Error handling returns appropriate status codes (400 for bad request, 404 for no options found)
- [x] Function logs all requests for debugging

**KPIs:**
- Success rate: > 95%
- Valid date format: 100%

### User Story 1.2: Update PolygonTester Component
**As a** developer testing options  
**I want** the PolygonTester to show real expiration dates from Polygon  
**So that** I can test actual options that exist in the market

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Remove all direct Polygon API calls from frontend code
- [x] Component calls `/option-expirations` edge function on mount
- [x] Loading state displays while fetching dates
- [x] Real expiration dates display as clickable buttons
- [x] Buttons show human-readable format (e.g., "Sep 19, 2025")
- [x] Error state displays if fetch fails with retry button
- [ ] Selected date highlights visually

**KPIs:**
- Zero CORS errors in console
- Date fetch success rate: > 95%
- User can click any date without errors

## Phase 2: Test & Verify Option Data

### User Story 2.1: Test Strike Price Functionality
**As a** developer  
**I want** to verify that clicking an expiration date fetches correct option data  
**So that** I know the integration is working properly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Clicking any expiration date triggers option quote fetch for $61 strike
- [x] Response includes all required fields:
  - [x] Strike price (matches requested $61)
  - [x] Expiration date (matches clicked date)
  - [x] Option type (CALL/PUT)
  - [x] Days to expiration (DTE)
  - [x] Mid price (not null)
  - [x] Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega)
  - [x] Implied volatility
  - [x] Open interest
- [x] Response displays in formatted JSON viewer
- [x] Loading spinner shows during fetch
- [x] Error messages are user-friendly

**KPIs:**
- All fields populated (not null): > 90%
- Strike price accuracy: 100%

### User Story 2.2: Document API Response Format
**As a** developer  
**I want** complete documentation of Polygon's response format  
**So that** future development can rely on accurate data structures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create response example in documentation
- [ ] Document each field's data type and format
- [ ] Note any fields that may be null
- [ ] Include example for both successful and error responses
- [ ] Document any data transformations applied
- [ ] Add to PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md

**KPIs:**
- Documentation completeness: 100%
- Example covers all edge cases

## Phase 3: Fix Bid/Ask Prices

### User Story 3.1: Debug Bid/Ask Price Normalization
**As a** developer  
**I want** to understand why bid/ask prices return null  
**So that** I can fix the price display issue

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Add detailed logging to `/option-quote` edge function
- [ ] Log raw Polygon response before any transformation
- [ ] Log each step of price normalization
- [ ] Identify exact format Polygon uses for prices
- [ ] Document findings in code comments
- [ ] Test with at least 5 different options

**KPIs:**
- Root cause identified: Yes/No
- Test coverage: 5+ different options

### User Story 3.2: Fix Price Calculation
**As a** trader viewing options  
**I want** to see accurate bid/ask prices  
**So that** I can make informed trading decisions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Bid prices display correctly (not null) for all tested options
- [ ] Ask prices display correctly (not null) for all tested options
- [ ] Prices match Polygon's web interface or other brokers (±$0.01)
- [ ] Price format shows 2 decimal places (e.g., $12.45)
- [ ] Spread calculation (ask - bid) is accurate
- [ ] Mid price calculation ((bid + ask) / 2) is correct

**KPIs:**
- Bid/ask populated rate: > 95%
- Price accuracy: ±$0.01 vs source
- Zero null prices in production

### User Story 3.3: Test Multiple Strikes
**As a** trader  
**I want** to verify prices work for different strike prices  
**So that** I can analyze various options strategies

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Add strike selection buttons: $61, $63, $67, $70
- [ ] Each strike + date combination returns valid data
- [ ] Bid/ask prices are logical (bid < ask)
- [ ] Higher strikes have lower prices for calls
- [ ] All price data formats consistently
- [ ] Test at least 20 combinations (5 dates × 4 strikes)

**KPIs:**
- Valid price for all combinations: > 95%
- Logical price relationships: 100%
