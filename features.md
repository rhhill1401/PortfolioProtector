# Features & User Stories Management

This document outlines how to manage feature development in PortfolioProtector using user stories and specifications.

## Feature Development Process

### 1. User Story Creation
Each new feature starts with a user story that captures:
- **Who** wants the feature (user persona)
- **What** they want to accomplish
- **Why** it provides value

### 2. Acceptance Criteria (AC)
Clear, testable requirements that define when the feature is complete.

### 3. Technical Specification
Detailed implementation plan created after user story approval.

## Feature Development Guidelines

### Before Starting
1. **Review existing code** - Check for reusable components
2. **Create user story** - Define clear requirements
3. **Get approval** - Ensure alignment with project goals
4. **Write specification** - Plan technical approach
5. **Set up tracking** - Use TodoWrite tool for tasks

### During Development
1. **Follow standards** - Use CODE_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md
2. **Incremental commits** - Small, focused changes
3. **Test continuously** - With real data
4. **Update documentation** - As you build

### After Completion
1. **Code review** - Follow review checklist
2. **Integration testing** - Full user journey
3. **Performance check** - Measure impact
4. **Documentation update** - Final docs
5. **Move to completed** - Archive feature docs

## Example User Story

```markdown
# User Story: Portfolio CSV Export

## Story
As a portfolio manager,
I want to export my positions to CSV,
So that I can analyze them in Excel or share with my accountant.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given I have positions displayed, when I click "Export CSV", then a CSV file downloads
- [ ] Given the CSV is downloaded, when I open it, then it contains all position data
- [ ] Must include: ticker, type, strike, expiry, contracts, premium, Greeks
- [ ] Should format dates as MM/DD/YYYY for Excel compatibility
- [ ] Should handle special characters in ticker symbols

## Priority
Medium

## Estimated Effort
Small

## Dependencies
- Existing portfolio display
- PapaParse library (already installed)

## Notes
- Consider adding filters before export
- May want PDF export in future
```

## Example Technical Specification

```markdown
# Technical Specification: Portfolio CSV Export

## User Story Reference
user-story-portfolio-csv-export.md

## Overview
Add CSV export functionality to the StockAnalysis component's Performance tab.

## Architecture Changes
### Frontend
- Add ExportButton component to PerformanceTab
- Use PapaParse for CSV generation
- Trigger download via blob URL

### Backend
- No backend changes required

## Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Create ExportButton component
   - Add to PerformanceTab
   - Style with existing Button component
2. [ ] Implement CSV generation
   - Format data structure
   - Use PapaParse.unparse()
3. [ ] Trigger file download
   - Create blob URL
   - Programmatic download
4. [ ] Add loading state
5. [ ] Handle errors gracefully

## Data Flow
```
Click Export → Format Data → Generate CSV → Create Blob → Download File
```

## Testing Strategy
- Test with various position counts
- Verify Excel compatibility
- Test special characters
- Check mobile download

## Performance Considerations
- Limit to 10,000 rows
- Process in chunks for large datasets

## Success Metrics
- Download success rate
- User adoption rate
- Support ticket reduction
```

## Feature Flags (Future)

```typescript
// features/config.ts
export const FEATURES = {
  CSV_EXPORT: process.env.REACT_APP_FEATURE_CSV_EXPORT === 'true',
  MOBILE_VIEW: process.env.REACT_APP_FEATURE_MOBILE === 'true',
  BACKTESTING: process.env.REACT_APP_FEATURE_BACKTEST === 'true',
};

// Usage in component
import { FEATURES } from '@/features/config';

{FEATURES.CSV_EXPORT && <ExportButton />}
```

## Prioritization Framework

### High Priority
- User-requested features
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Security updates

### Medium Priority
- UI/UX enhancements
- New integrations
- Developer tools
- Documentation

### Low Priority
- Nice-to-have features
- Experimental features
- Cosmetic changes

## Success Metrics

### Feature Success Indicators
- **Adoption Rate**: % of users using feature
- **Engagement**: Frequency of use
- **Performance**: Load time impact
- **Quality**: Bug reports per feature
- **Satisfaction**: User feedback score

### Tracking Methods
```typescript
// Event tracking
window.analytics?.track('Feature Used', {
  feature: 'csv_export',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  userId: user.id
});
```

## Communication

### Status Updates
- Update feature status in this file
- Move completed features to archive
- Document lessons learned
- Share metrics

### Feedback Loop
1. Gather user feedback
2. Analyze usage metrics
3. Iterate on features
4. Document improvements

## Remember

1. **User value first** - Every feature must provide clear value
2. **Keep it simple** - Start with MVP, iterate based on feedback
3. **Test with real users** - Get feedback early and often
4. **Measure success** - Define and track metrics
5. **Document everything** - Future you will thank you
6. **Reuse existing code** - Follow "Upgrade, Don't Replace"
7. **Performance matters** - Monitor impact on app speed
8. **Accessibility always** - Features must be usable by all
